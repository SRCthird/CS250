# Final Summary

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? 
User needs are interpreted by engaging directly with feedback and market trends to inform development. Implementing these into a program involves prioritizing relevant features and needs that align with user expectations, as shown by the strategic decision to focus on Health and Wellness travel locations in one part of the SNHU Travel project.

### How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Creating "user stories" creates a clear understanding of what users need and expect from the software. This method helps break down development into manageable chunks, focusing on delivering specific functionalities that meet these needs through cycles of development, feedback, and refinement.

### How do I approach developing programs?
Currently I approach programming through trial and error, as I currently do not have a team or a prefered structure. Although I plan on approaching program development through the Scrum-agile methodology, focusing on iterative progress, flexibility, and responsiveness to changes in he future when my role as a Software Dev is more solid. This includes breaking down tasks into sprints, using user stories to guide development, and maintaining open communication within the team.

### What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
In future projects, I hope to continue using Scrum-agile processes like regular sprints, daily stand-ups, and continuous feedback loops. These processes facilitate effective project management, quick adaptation to change, and a focus on stakeholder satisfaction.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means actively contributing to a collaborative environment through effective communication, flexibility, and commitment. It involves sharing progress, addressing obstacles promptly, and working together to find solutions that align with the project's goals. This also means being honest with your team about the feasability of certain aspects of the project and timeline.
